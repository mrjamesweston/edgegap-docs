# What is Edgegap?
Edgegap is a cross-platform fully managed game server host. Whether you're a starting out Indie or AAA Game Developer, anyone can take the reign and gain access to over 615+ locations that grant you a 58% reduction in latency versus other providers. Not only that, they've also made things super easy! Their dashboard is simplified to make updating things a breeze as seeing where your players are playing the most. As well as being free-to-start. No upfront costs or fees with extremely competitive pay-per-minute hosting so you only pay for what is used which lowers your costs by up to 70%!

Interesting in what you hear so far? Don't take it from me, see for yourself with their [Case Studies](https://edgegap.com/gaming/case-studies) and [Performance Benchmark](https://edgegap.com/resources/performance-benchmark) where they was able to scale up to 14 Million Users in just 60 minutes.

# Getting Started with Edgegap

You need to sign up, you don't even need a Credit Card to start! Their Free Trial Tier grants you 1 Application with 1 Deployment (constrained to 60 minutes per deployment) as well as a time-limited Matchmaker so you can test out a lot of things for free!

# Getting Started in the Edgegap Learner Project

In my Edgegap learner Project you'll be met with a <b>Game Instance</b> Class named <u>EdgegapInstance</u>. Inside of this you'll be met with some things you don't need to worry about! 

!> DO NOT Touch the Server Only Category! This pulls some info from Edgegap's <i>Arbitrium</i> which is then used later on in the Server! Hence the name "Server Only"!
