# Welcome to the Edgegap Learner Documentation.
?> This documentation serves as not only knowledge for the Edgegap Community, but to also help out Austin himself!

!> Heads Up! This documentation goes hand-in-hand with Austin's Edgegap Learner Project. It shows you a set-up on how to Create Deployments, Create Matchmaking Tickets, Get Matchmaking Tickets, and Cancel Matchmaking Tickets.

!> This documentation also is taken directly from the [Edgegap API](https://docs.edgegap.com/api/) and [Documentation](https://docs.edgegap.com/docs/)
> If you require support for anything, please DM Austin on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/austinjgaudet) or on Discord at austin.james. I don't use other channels besides this for communication.



## Ready to Dive in?
!> NOTE! This guide is not a how-to on how to do most things and assumes you have done the following: [Built the Unreal Engine from Source to support Dedicated Servers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-dedicated-servers-in-unreal-engine), [Downloaded and Set-up Docker](https://docs.docker.com/guides/getting-started/), and have a C++ Project (either converted from Blueprints or Native) for Dedicated Servers.
